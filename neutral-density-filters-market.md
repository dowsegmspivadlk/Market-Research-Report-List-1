<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neutral-density Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reflective Type</li><li>Reflective Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neutral-density (ND) filters are categorized into non-reflective and reflective types, serving distinct market needs in photography and videography. Non-reflective ND filters are typically made from optical glass or resin, allowing for consistent light reduction without color distortion, making them ideal for long exposures. Reflective ND filters, on the other hand, utilize coatings that reflect certain wavelengths, effectively reducing light while maintaining color balance. Both types are essential for achieving desired exposure levels and creative effects in various lighting conditions.</p></p>
